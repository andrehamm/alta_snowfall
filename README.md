# Data Visualization and Simple Linear Regression
This code takes hitoric snowfall data from Alta, UT and historic temperature data from Salt Lake City, UT to predict snowfall. 

The script data-visualization.py take two arguments, --visualize, and --train-predict. 

--visualize will show useful infographics about historic snowfall in Alta, UT. 

--train-predict will predict snowfall for the next twenty years at Alta, UT Using a simple linear regression model and plot the data.

I used the above code by Martin Palkovic as a starting point, and used his the linear regression model he provided to train and predict snowfall in Alta, UT
